## 我眼中的闽江公园 Min River Park in My Eyes

This was a website I co-created with a friend back in 2007. The subject of the website was [a park](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E9%97%BD%E6%B1%9F%E5%85%AC%E5%9B%AD) in Foochow (Fuzhou), China that I used to visit very frequently. The website was created with [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver
) and [FrontPage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) with a lot of nested `<table>`s. 

Both the park and the landscape of web development have changed vastly since then. I am now giving the website a new home on Github mainly for nostalgia reasons.
